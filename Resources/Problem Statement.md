# Problem Statement:

Understanding and Integrating Generation Z into the Workforce

Given the rapid entry of Generation Z into the workforce, organizations face challenges in attracting, retaining, and engaging this new generation of employees. The key issues include:

1. Adapting to Gen Z's expectations for work-life integration, flexibility, and rapid career progression.
2. Addressing Gen Z's preference for diverse, entrepreneurial opportunities within stable employment environments.
3. Overcoming the generational differences in work habits, communication styles, and expectations for development and recognition.
4. Ensuring that company values align with Gen Z's emphasis on social responsibility, ethics, and diversity.
5. Bridging the gap in attracting Gen Z women to traditionally male-dominated fields like STEM.
